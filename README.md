# Hey Brain!
Attempt at creating a BCI that filters online eeg data from a Cyton Board and classifies and engagement command.

### Instruction
To run, extract the contents of the **data_extract_here.zip** folder to the **data** folder. From there, I recommend running the **data_exploration.ipynb** or ***ERP_Classification.ipynd** notebooks.

If you are looking to record data off the Cyton board with the prompted events, look at the **TrialRecorder.py**

### Future
The plan is to build out a user interface for data recording and neural feedback session. Traces of this system exist, but probably won't run as of this moment in time.

#### Notes:
Two coding resources were heavily used in the project, so you might see code from the following resources.
